            <P>At the age of 17 I graduated high school and began to manage a band full time. I also wrote all of the songs for the band, and took up guitar and lead vocal duties. We managed to tour a few times and secure two contracts from some indie labels. It was a ton of fun and gave me some valuable work experience.</P>
            <p>I also took several hours of private art classes a week all throughout middle school and high school which turned into some amazing opportunities to teach painting at several restaurants around the Orange County area for Wine and Paint nights.</p>
            <p>In 2016 I started a comic book company named "Super Dope Comix" where I managed to write, pencil, ink, and letter my first comicbook. We took the comic and some merchandise I had also created to a few comic book conventions around Southern California and Nevada, it was an absolute blast and I learned a ton about what it takes to take something from concept to completion.</p>
